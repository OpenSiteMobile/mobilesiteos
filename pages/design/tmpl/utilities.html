				Here are several links to on-line site transcoders for mobile devices.
				All you do to use a transcoder is go to their website and enter a url
				into the site's home page input box. Then the transcoder will take the
				returned web page code for that url and render it in a format more
				suitable for mobile display. It's not perfect, but can sometimes do
				a reasonable job of "mobilizing" a "desktop only" website. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Many (most?) transcoder sites allow you to encode the "to be rendered" url
				into a url query to their site, thus making it possible to pass rendering
				directly through from your website or app without having to have the user
				enter url text directly. Still, the problem is that you don't know what
				the user's device is ahead of time, and how it will actually render pages
				of the linked site. Thus the whole point of <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> software
				is to make sure your website won't need transcoders to render your site for
				mobile display.

				Also included here are links to several of the major affiliate advertising
				programs for site monetization. Adding mobile compliant and correctly
				sized ad's to your responsive design website is actually going to be one
				of your greatest challenges.

				Here at <u>OpenSiteMobile</u>, we have spent countless hours trying to integrate
				<u>Google AdSense</u> (and the original <u>AdMob</u> ad's) into our code
				with as little compromise as possible. We feel we have been reasonably successful, but
				more ad flexibility would have been greatly appreciated.

				The cause of such slow progress in ad placement for responsive designs is
				probably due to the preference of mobile app's vs. web based app's. Hopefully,
				responsive web advertisement placement will improve in the future. If you know
				of new responsive ad technology, don't be shy about dropping us an email or comment.

			<div class='pgrph'>
				Please note, several of these sites only produce ad's for mobile app's as
				opposed to mobile web sites or responsive websites. We list them here so
				we too can keep checking back to see if they eventually start serving
				responsively sized ad's for responsive web designed sites. Progress is
				still exasperatingly slow.
