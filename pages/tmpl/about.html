		<h2><u>MobileSiteOS™</u> is Open Source Software</h2>

		<div class='pgrph well'>
			<p>
				It is not our intention to replace any of the established libraries that
				you may currently be using. And <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> is dependent
				on several you may be familiar with: jQuery, <u>Modernizr</u> and <u>Underscore.js</u>.
				You can however use <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> with any other library or JavaScript code
				you like. Almost all of our code falls under one global variable: <code>'msos'</code>.
				<u>MobileSiteOS™</u> is more like an extension layer in that we try to add mobile website
				specific functionality on top of your existing pages or code.
			</p>

			<p>
				What really makes us different is our style of coding and our methods of code execution.
				We try very hard to place all code into specific function modules, which we then only
				load as needed (on demand). Our emphasis is on "multi-content-page" websites where each
				page's specific functionality is loaded only once when needed, not only at page load.
				<u>MobileSiteOS™</u> can be used with equal success for websites made up of many
				individual HTML5 pages or by utilizing our <code>msos.page</code> module
				and <u>BackboneJS</u> for creating a single-page, content injection website.
			</p>

			<p>
				As it turns out, this style of code execution can also be applied to single page app integration
				through AngularJS. We developed our own version of AngularJS called
				<a class="msos_link notranslate" href='http://ngmomentum.com/'>NgMomentum</a> which
				includes our "module postloading code", allowing on-demand script/content injection via
				AngularJS coding and <u>MobileSiteOS™</u>. So you don't have to wait for the ever more
				complicated and verbose AngularJS version 2 for this very handy feature.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="msos_legend">
			<h3>Methodology</h3>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				First, by using typical JavaScript script injection, we load our library dependencies and base
				code as deferred scripts (ie: order is important). Then we load all <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> 
				modules individually and asynchronously. Order and dependencies here are not important
				because no dependent code is executed until all code is loaded. We do this using our
				 <code>msos.require()</code> and <code>msos.provide()</code> module
				loading functions. Dependent modules are 'required' at the top of each module, and each
				module is registered by our <code>msos.provide()</code> method.
			</div>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				Plus, <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> takes care to only load modules once, while
				holding execution until everything is ready. Thus module dependencies can chain
				down without having to know or care what dependencies lie below. And yes, this
				does add some complexity to module design (which is not unlike the "digest"
				and directive "priority" design found in AngularJS). We aren't saying this is
				the best way or the only way to write JavaScript. It is a process which we have tried
				to refine as a 'best compromise' between speed and simplicity for the development of small
				to medium size mobile websites. It does allow the introduction of new HTML, CSS and
				JavaScript code at any time in our "content" rendering process. The proof of concept
				is that we were able to integrate this process into AngularJS module code loading too,
				with equal success.

			<h3>Why use "responsive website design" instead of "mobile only" or "device apps"?</h3>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				The maintenance of multiple websites for displaying similar content in
				different formats is difficult for small business or individuals to justify.
				And maintaining "mobile apps" for each platform and the constant downloading of
				updates is becoming a nightmare too. If a single website can do a reasonably good
				job of mobile through desktop content rendering, the cost savings in time and resources
				can be quite significant.
			</div>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				That is the reason we only develop "web app" applications, and not
				"phone app" or "tablet app" specific software. "Mobile apps" were a reasonable
				path to take when the first iPhone and Android phones were introduced, given
				the manufacturer's desire for suitable functionality and ultimate control.
				But there are ever more issues with creating good mobile apps these days,
				such as the expense and constant updates, etc. And there is still the need for
				desktop access for many companies and individuals. Nor does providing content
				via smartphones or tablets necessarily require an app. It is our opinion that
				there will always be a place for good browser based web applications providing
				useful or entertaining content.
			</div>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				Just because we develop "web app" software doesn't mean our software
				or modules couldn't be used in HTML5 driven "mobile app" applications. By all
				means, we would encourage others to do so. We use only open source technologies
				such as JavaScript, <u>CSS</u> and <u>HTML5</u>, so all
				software can be modified or patterned as required for your particular needs.
