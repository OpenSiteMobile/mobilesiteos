		<h2><u>OpenSiteMobile</u>&nbsp;Development</h2> 

		<div class='pgrph well'>

			<p>
				Our original development goal was to create software for mobile websites.
				Later, we expanded that goal to that of creating adjustable display size,
				or responsive websites. And except for our 'msos.page' module, our code
				is relatively transparent by object oriented programming standards. It should
				be easy enough to "dumb down" as you like.
			</p>
			<p>
				And our intent has always remained the same. We want to provide usable
				and flexible software that works on as many devices as possible. In that
				vane, we strive to incorporate as many of the best "open source"
				technologies and features available, into our software.

			<h2>Development Strategy</h2>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				<p>
					Our development strategy is not unlike what
					<a class="msos_link notranslate" href='http://html5boilerplate.com/'>HTML5 BoilerPlate</a> or
					<a class="msos_link notranslate" href='http://boilerplatejs.org/'>BoilerPlateJS</a> are trying
					to do to jump-start website development. As compared to&nbsp;<u>HTML5 BoilerPlate</u>&nbsp;or
					<a class="msos_link notranslate" href='http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/'>Mobile BoilerPlate</a>,
					we have adopted a more holistic approach in that we are trying to integrate as many of the best
					mobile web technologies into a convenient "multi-page-content" development package. To that end,
					we have always used&nbsp;<u>HTML5 BoilerPlate</u>&nbsp;as a reference for base&nbsp;<u>HTML5</u>&nbsp;page
					design best practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus our emphasis is more on the integration of basic structures needed to provide good website
					display on a variety of devices. With our modular code system, we use browser detection to load
					platform dependent code on demand. The same principles as prescribed by&nbsp;<u>HTML5 BoilerPlate</u>,
					but in a clean, multi-page environment. We aren't trying to re-invent the wheel, just make it roll
					more smoothly.
