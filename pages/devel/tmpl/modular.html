				What really defines our method of coding is our style of code execution
				and modularization. We try very hard to place all code into specific
				function modules which we then only load as necessary. Our emphasis is on
				multi-content-page websites where each page's content specific functionality
				is loaded on demand, not all at once. As this site demonstrates, we use a
				hybrid type of "single page" website with content injection on demand. All
				the content (templates, CSS, JavaScript) is loaded as or by "modules",
				exploiting the same basic techniques original developed in our module loading
				code.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our modules also tend to have a more basic character too. Not very object
				oriented in the "building classes" sort of way. All functions fall under
				the same module object name, with most functions being completely autonomous
				and self contained. This allows easy search and replace by object name,
				as well as the ability to quickly move code around as improvements or
				code consolidation becomes apparent. This follows our programming style
				of "start simple" and "add complexity" only as needed. It is also important
				to note that our module object names directly relate to their relative
				folder/file path. So knowing a module's name means knowing where it is
				relative to all other modules in our set of scripts.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also add a lot of debugging code. Even though our modules may be a little
				verbose by common JavaScript programming standards, it isn't such a significant
				disadvantage since we only load code as needed. And as mentioned earlier,
				our more complex coding involves script execution timing where having good
				debugging output is a definite advantage (absolute must?). Plus, loading only
				the required code for each page means that module "code compression" is not as
				important either. You can if you want, but a 7kB file to a 4kB file doesn't mean
				a whole lot when loaded over a series of "pages". Once code is cached, it all
				runs the same.
