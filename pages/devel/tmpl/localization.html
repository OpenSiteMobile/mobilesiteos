				Application localization is another area where being able to load files
				on demand is a destinct advantage. Many JavaScript libraries and scripts that
				do address the localization issue, require you to load all available
				localization code for each widget or page, at one time. So every language
				a widget might be used in, has to be made available from the start. Not
				very efficient!
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we load all modules asynchronously and in a controlled
				manor, we first determine the most likely localization language and other
				files for that user, then just request them. And all country/locale
				code is user selectable too, just in case <u>MobileSiteOSâ„¢</u> guesses
				wrong or a user's native language is not available.

		<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

				As mentioned on our "Dependency Mangagment" page, we originally derived
				our module loading techniques from those of the
				<a class="msos_link notranslate" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
				The main reason for this was that they had the best localization (<code>i18n</code>)
				management code available at the time. The ability to load only the <code>i18n</code> 
				files needed for each user independently, was one quick way to minimize
				required download bandwidth to acceptable amounts. So even if you don't
				think you need script loading on demand otherwise, if you plan to ever offer
				localized content, you will probably want to load localization files on an "as
				needed" basis for any serious mobile web based application.
			<p>

			<p>
				Due to the complexity and effort required by website localization, this is
				one area that is still an ongoing project. Some widgets and pages work
				better than others. And this is still a relatively underdeveloped area,
				given that mobile development has been geared more towards mobile apps.
				Mobile apps typically provide only the specific localization needed by each
				download, since they can "poll" the user's device or preferences ahead of time.
				And this is relatively efficient unless the user wants to use multiple languages.
				So all we are doing is allowing the same efficiency in a "language selectable" web
				app environment.
