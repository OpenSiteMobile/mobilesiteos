				<u>MobileSiteOS™</u> dependency management was originally derived from the early
				<a class="msos_link notranslate" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a> style
				of module calling and loading. Since then, it has evolved into its own form, more like
				<a class="msos_link notranslate" href="http://requirejs.org/">Require.js</a> or
				<a class="msos_link notranslate" href="http://labjs.com/">LAB.js</a>.
				It is however a much lighter, more application specific code set than either
				<u>Require.js</u> or <u>LAB.js</u>. It is also intended solely for client
				side (browser) execution.

			<p>
				<u>MobileSiteOS™</u> uses simple <u>jQuery ajax</u> calls to load
				all modules asynchronously. By design, our modules do not execute dependent code
				immediately. We use "initializing" functions, pushed onto function arrays with
				defined execution points. So <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> controls the loading
				of modules, making sure to only load modules once, while holding execution until
				the desired time. The benefit, module dependencies can chain down without having
				to know or care what dependencies lie below.

			<h3>Too Complex?</h3>

				Admittedly, this does add some to module execution complexity, but the
				result is that we achieve similar results to <u>Require.js</u> or
				<u>LAB.js</u> with very simple module calls and much less code. It
				is a more structured environment, better (only?) suited to browser execution,
				but does allow very fast page loads in a very controlled manor. Does it work? The
				proof being our incorporation of many standard <u>jQuery</u> and other
				scripts or plug-ins as <u>MobileSiteOS™</u> style modules. Don't like it?
				Cut it out and use <u>Require.js</u> or <u>LAB.js</u> instead.

				One recently added benefit: content injection via JavaScript can include more complex JavaScript
				and CSS interaction too. As demonstrated by this site, each "page" is just new
				content being added to the base "index.html" page. So only the JavaScript required for
				each "content page" needs to be loaded at any give time, which is very fast and very efficient.
