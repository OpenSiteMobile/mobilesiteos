		<h2>Responsive Design via JavaScript,&nbsp;<u>CSS</u></h2>

		<select id='change_size'></select>

		<div class='pgrph well'>
			<div id='amazon_prod_ad'></div>
			<p>
				Our basic approach is different from many "responsive website display"
				strategies. We use fixed display sized web pages based on the view size
				of the device, or on the user's preference. This differs from the more
				typical use of media queries and/or self-sizing page elements that are
				more commonly employed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our reasoning is this. It is easier to design and troubleshoot a page layout
				when you know what each layout's end result should be. We apply specific
				<u>CSS</u>&nbsp;to size pages in several standard widths, similar to common
				media query break points. This allows any browser to view each sized page, with
				a JavaScript determined size being the default.
			</p>

			<p>
				Is this the only way to do it? No. We use JavaScript to determine which
				<u>CSS</u>&nbsp;to load on demand. You could however just as easily use media queries
				and our sizing&nbsp;<u>CSS</u>&nbsp;or yours, to do the same thing. Again,
				one advantage doing it our way is that we only load style information as needed
				for that page's display. No loading all&nbsp;<u>CSS</u>&nbsp;'media query' sizing
				code, when only one version is actually being used on that particular device. And
				our sizing output can be used to control other size specific code as well. Think
				advertizing displays and widget controls, etc.

			<h2>Yet Another Responsive Grid System</h2>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				So, yes, we have our own responsive grid system. But in all fairness, we have been
				developing it for a long, long time. Our latest version is heavily derived from the
				excellent work done in&nbsp;<u>Twitter's Bootstrap</u>&nbsp;framework, but with our
				past improvements applied. Our version is more "mobile specific" in that it is only
				a 12 section grid and is only based on percentage width sections. Very light,
				but very flexible. Plus it adds the ability to be very "diplay size" specific since
				our grid system isn't based on media queries. We don't have the problem of working
				through the "cascading" of media query grid rules because each sized grid stylesheet
				is enable/disabled independently by our display size control code.
			</div>

			<div class='pgrph'>
				Is it better than&nbsp;<u>Bootstrap's</u>&nbsp;grid code? We think so, especially
				for mobile applications. Are you forced to use our grid? Not at all. If you prefer,
				you can use&nbsp;<u>Bootstrap's</u>&nbsp;version instead. We have a module for that,
				ready to go. Or you can use any one of the other fine examples available on the web.
