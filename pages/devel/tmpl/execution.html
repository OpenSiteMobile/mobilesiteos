		<h2>Script Execution</h2>

		<div class='pgrph well'>
			<div id='amazon_prod_ad'></div>
			<p>
				For JavaScript running in a web browser, timing is everything. The key
				to a great user experience is to have all&nbsp;<u>HTML5</u>, JavaScript
				and&nbsp;<u>CSS</u>&nbsp;code load quickly and seamlessly. The trick is
				to do it in such a way that the user isn't aware of all the time consuming
				loading and executing processes taking place. With that in mind,
				&nbsp;<u>MobileSiteOS™</u>&nbsp;offers probably the most controlled script
				and page execution environment available.
			</p>

			<p>
				This distinction is intentional and due to our base requirement that
				all software modules be loadable asynchronously. As explained under the
				"Modular Code" section of our "Development" pages, when all modules can
				load independently, there is no need for concern about module dependencies
				and whether or not all scripting is ready. Through very precise timing,
				the proper code is always ready in the proper order. This even works for
				most typical&nbsp;<u>jQuery</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>Bootstrap</u>&nbsp;code as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				The drawback to this scheme is complexity. Thus much of our work on
				&nbsp;<u>MobileSiteOS™</u>&nbsp;has been directed towards making it as developer friendly
				as possible.

			<h3>Its All About Timing</h3>

			<p>The basic execution timing goes as follows:</p>

			<ul class="msos_list timings">
				<li>
					Our&nbsp;<code>/msos/base.min.js</code>&nbsp;and the application specific&nbsp;<code>config.js</code>&nbsp;
					files are called in the document head of each page, using standard script
					tags, and load synchronously.
				</li>
				<li>
					The&nbsp;<code>config.js</code>&nbsp;file loads all JavaScript library dependencies and
					non-modular&nbsp;<u>MobileSiteOS™</u>&nbsp;code by injecting non-blocking "deferred"
					(where available) script tags into the document head. For multi-page applications, this
					includes a page specific external&nbsp;<code>.js</code>&nbsp;file for each page. No JavaScript
					module function calls are allowed directly in the page, for obvious reasons.
				</li>
				<li>
					At this point,&nbsp;<u>CSS</u>, JavaScript and the&nbsp;<u>HTML5</u>&nbsp;page are just loading,
					at least until the DOM page loading is completely. Then the&nbsp;<code>jQuery(document).ready()</code>&nbsp;
					method fires and calls our&nbsp;<code>msos.check_deferred_scripts()</code>&nbsp;
					function. It checks to see whether all deferred scripts have loaded, or loops as needed
					until they do.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once all deferred scripts are confirmed loaded, we call our
					<code>msos.run_onload()</code>&nbsp;function. This is the main execution
					control subroutine which evaluates the readiness of called modules and
					also makes sure all browser environment, display size and cookie information
					is ready too. Called modules may or may not be still loading at this point.
					The&nbsp;<code>msos.run_onload()</code>&nbsp;function loops over
					itself until each level of programmed execution readiness is achieved.
				</li>
				<li>
					There are roughly five evaluation levels to satisfy in&nbsp;<code>msos.run_onload()</code>&nbsp;
					before all scripting components are allowed to execute. Localization modules
					and the corresponding culture specific files they use are a good example of the
					most taxing to this process. They each take presidence over the other in order to
					make them fully available to the original calling module. Note also that, even though
					a given loop through&nbsp;<code>msos.run_onload()</code>&nbsp;may get to a certain
					evaluation level, a new dependency might be added such that the evaluation process backs
					up a step or two.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once all five evaluation levels are passed, we run five levels of array stored
					code execution functions, then finish with misc. debugging and environment specific
					function calls. These five levels of code execution include "pre" and "post" execution
					code required internally by&nbsp;<u>MobileSiteOS™</u>&nbsp;, and three levels of
					execution for module based code. Thus, a module may enforce ordered interactions
					between code components and other modules.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Efficient Code Execution</h3>

			<p>
				Simple right? We did mention that this was complex. Over time, our
				development efforts have shifted code loading and execution around to
				best address what works most efficiently in state of the art browsers.
				Thus, timing the calling and loading of code to best match a browser's
				ability to process it, is the key. The good news is that for the most
				part, all you need to know is this:
			</p>

			<ul class="msos_list timings">
				<li>
					You call each module with our&nbsp;<code>msos.require()</code>&nbsp;method, with the
					module name entered as a "dot" separated string.
				</li>
				<li>
					You start each module with our&nbsp;<code>msos.provide()</code>&nbsp;method, with the
					module name again entered as a string.
				</li>
				<li>
					You add each module's dependency module(s) with another&nbsp;<code>msos.require()</code>,
					with that name entered as a string.
				</li>
				<li>
					Somewhere in the original module (usually at the end) you assign
					any dependency module or&nbsp;<u>DOM</u>&nbsp;acting functions to be run at
					the appropriate time, after page load. There are three levels available,
					using these arrays:&nbsp;<code>msos.onload_func_start</code>,
					&nbsp;<code>msos.onload_functions</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>msos.onload_func_done</code>.
					Simply "push" each function onto the appropriate array.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most applications only need the&nbsp;<code>msos.onload_functions</code>&nbsp;array, but as
					mentioned earlier, some process types like&nbsp;<code>i18n</code>&nbsp;require further
					layered code execution. Your more complex modules may too.
				</li>
			</ul>
