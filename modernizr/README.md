=============

Modernizr.js (github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) as used in MobileSiteOS

The current and development (if any) copies of Modernizr.js currently being used by MobileSiteOS. These use to be just the standard built, custom modernizr.js and modernizr.min.js files, as generated by the http://modernizr.com/download/ download selection page. We still rename them by version, but from v320 on, they are for reference only. We now add the specific Modernizr code we use directly into our base.uc.js and base.min.js files.

These changes are the result of the full Modernizr file becoming so big with new checks (which is a good thing), and our standard practice of adding specific module code directly into that module. From this point on, we will have a "base" of Modernizr tests in the "base.js" file, and additional tests in each module which requires any specific new ones.
