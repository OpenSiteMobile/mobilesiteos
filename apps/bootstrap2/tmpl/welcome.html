        <h1>Welcome to AngularJs Bootstrap-UI via MobileSiteOS</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
        This demo highlights the use of MobileSiteOS as the mechanism to load individual Bootstrap-UI modules versus
        using the full version of the AngularJS Bootstrap-UI framework. It also demonstrates the possibility of
        loading many individual page "content" sections via the same single page application, often called "lazy-loading"
        of code and content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using MobileSiteOS also allows the ease of loading JavaScript, HTML and CSS as modules. Most important, MSOS
        modules call their own dependencies. You don't have to keep track of dependency chains. Complex dependency
        managment is handled seemlessly in the background, unlike other module loading scripts.
    </p>

    <h2>MSOS Version of AngularJS</h2>
    
    <p>
        For the most part, the MSOS version of AngularJS is an experimental attempt to "improve" on the standard AngularJS
        coding for use with MobileSiteOS. Since MobileSiteOS uses UnderscoreJS, Modernizr and jQuery as hard dependencies,
        our version of AngularJS does too. That is, previous AngularJS code which was duplicated by UnderscoreJS, Modernizr
        and/or jQuery, was removed from AngularJS. So no jQLite stuff, and as much unused code was removed as possible.
        For example, MobileSiteOS can't utilize AngularJS's self bootstrapping code due to MSOS module loading verification
        and execution timing. So bootstrapping must be done manually at the end of MSOS code processing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Except for the "setupModuleLoader" function returning an "angular_module" object of loaded modules, the MSOS
        version of AngularJS is little different in operation. The "angular_module" object was added for tracking
        AngularJS modules as they are loaded, and is used by our "ng.util.postloader" module. The MSOS version
        of AngularJS has also been cleaned up a bit to try and remove some of the more "ambiguous" style of coding
        that was used. This was done mostly as an exercise into seeing exactly how AngularJS goes about doing what
        it does so well. The intend was to clarify, and not change the basic operations.
